Bike game is a side-scrolling stunt cycling game where you jump, flip, and avoid obstacles to score points.

## ðŸŽ® How to Play

- **Jump:** Long-press
- **Scoring:**  
  - Passing a cat successfully increases your score.  
  - Hitting a cat or **failing to ace the landing** decreases your score.

- **Spoiler:** You must land within Â±45Â° degrees of the tangent of the mountain slope...on your wheels

# Post-mortem

Most endless scrollers are packed with beautiful scenery â€” but the irony is that you rarely have time to actually see it. Youâ€™re too busy juggling jumps, tricks, combos, and enemies. It starts to feel more like multitasking than like enjoying the ride.

With this project, I wanted to go in the opposite direction. The background is simplified and the interactions are pared down, so the game becomes more about flow.

By the way, Iâ€™m just tickled that the bicycle emoji worked out so well. ðŸš´
